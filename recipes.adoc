=== Caramel Apple Pie

This caramel apple pie is a very sweet two crust pie filled with
caramel and apples. The homemade pie crust should be prepared

a smaller pie tin, double the recipe.

For the crust you'll need:

* 2c flour
* 1/2c cold water
* 1/2c butter (softened, diced)
* 1/2c shortening

Preparation:

. Mix together ingredients in a bowl until slightly doughy and still damp
. Roll mixture separate mixture into two halves
. Wrap each half in plastic or in a ziplock bag
. Refrigerate overnight

For the pie filling you'll need:

* 6-8 apples, a mix of Granny Smith and sweeter apples such as Fuji work best
* 1/2c brown sugar
* 1tbsp cinnamon
* 1 bag soft caramel candies
* 1tbsp butter

Preparation:

. Pre-heat over to 350F/180C
. Remove pie crust from fridge
. Roll out one pie crust on a floured rolling mat to size of baking pan
. Place rolled crust in pie pan
. Roll out second pie crust, leave on rolling mat for now
. Start water in double boiler
. Unwrap caramel candies and set aside in bowl
. Add butter and caramel candies to double boiler,
  stir occasionally while performing other prep work
. Peel, core, and slice apples. This is done most easily 
  with a hand cranked apple peeler. Put apple slices into bowl.
