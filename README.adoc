== Innovate Everywhere Recipes

You can view these recipes three ways:

* Clone the repo and open MAIN.recipes.adoc locally in a browser that supports
  AsciiDoc or in another tool such as asciidoctor

* Build a local copy in the format of your choosing.

* The GitHub preview of the in-development recipes is at
<<adoc/MAIN.recipes.adoc#>>.

=== Known Issues

The github preview does not display images correctly.

The pdf build stretches images to fill the page, distoring them
and consuming extra space in a way that is not visually appealing.

The pdf build table of contents is only 1 level deep.

The html build does not copy pictures to the necessary location.

=== Contributing

Want to help? We love to hear that! Below are a few hints to guide you.

==== Writing

These release notes are written in the AsciiDoc (`*.adoc`) format. For some
great AsciiDoc documentation, see https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/.

==== Updating Content

. Fork this repository.

. Make the intended changes. (Make sure to read <<sec.github-preview>>.)

. Validate and build a test version (see below for more details)

. Submit the changes as a pull request

=== Building the Recipe book

For validation and test purposes follow the steps below:

. Install the DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (daps) package from the
link:https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Documentation:Tools/daps[Documentation:Tools]
openSUSE Build Service project.

. Use the `make` to build all required documents. For a single HTML document,
for example `make single-html`.

=== Keeping the GitHub Preview of The Recipe Book Intact

The GitHub preview mode is handy but comes with a couple of snags compared to
the build of the release notes that is used for the SUSE Web site:

** GitHub will simply render a preview of a single `*.adoc` file using
AsciiDoctor's built-in HTML conversion. GitHub previews do not support
embedding one AsciiDoc file in another, you can only use links between them.

** The build combines multiple `*.adoc` files into a single HTML
output file. It is based on AsciiDoctor's AsciiDoc-to-DocBook-XML conversion,
the result of which is then further converted into HTML/PDF using DAPS and the
DocBook XSL stylesheets.

For this reason, the central file `adoc/MAIN.recipes.adoc` and the top level
adoc files contain somewhat unsightly `ifdef`/`ifndef` blocks that check whether 
the file is displayed in the GitHub preview, switching between using links to other files
for GitHub and `include::` statement in all other cases.
